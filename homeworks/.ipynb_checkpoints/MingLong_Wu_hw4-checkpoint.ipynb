    "The test_binsearch.py is written to test boundaries of input as much as possible. Testing cases have also been set to test as many lines of code as possible. However, there are some problems yet to be addressed in the binary_search code for now. For example, if there is 'Nan' in the input list, then the output cannot be predicted (sometimes correct but sometimes not, depending on where 'Nan' is ordered relative to needle). Other examples of problems include unsorted input and extremely large list of input (causing stack overflow). To address these problems, code modification is required. It may also reduce efficiency of the binary_search if time consuming checks are placed in the code."
